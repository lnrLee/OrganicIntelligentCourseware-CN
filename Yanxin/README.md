 Abstract:This paper investigates the adoption of measures used to evaluate complex networks properties 
 in the characterization of the complexity of data sets in machine learning applications. These measures
 are obtained from a graph based representation of a data set. A graph representation has several 
 interesting properties as it can encode local neighborhood relations, as well as global characteristics
 of the data. These measures are evaluated in a meta-learning framework, where the objective is to predict
 which classifier will have better performance in a given task, in a pairwise basis comparison, based on 
 the complexity measures. Results were compared to traditional data set complexity characterization metrics,
 and shown the competitiveness of the proposed measures derived from the graph representation when compared
 to traditional complexity characterization metrics.
